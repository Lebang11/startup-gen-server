Here's the updated README without the database-related information:

# Startup-gen-server

## Overview
This project is a web application built with Node.js, Express.js, and TensorFlow.js. It provides APIs for managing trending products and topics, as well as a machine learning component for time series prediction using TensorFlow.js.

## Features
- **Express.js API:** Endpoints to manage trending products and topics.
- **TensorFlow.js:** Load, preprocess data, train a model, and make predictions on time series data.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Node.js (v14 or later)**
- **TensorFlow.js**

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Lebang11/startup-gen-server
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd startup-gen-server
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
To use the time series prediction feature, you can pass the `isazi_ts_dataset.csv` file to the `/csv` POST request. This will run the prediction model and return the predictions.
